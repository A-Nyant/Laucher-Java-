# Launcher-PartA-Java
Here is a summary of the project.
This was part one of a two part project. For part A, we worked alone. For part B, we worked with a partner.
For version a, we had some instructions
We had to have three classes, one for the launcher, one for the bullet and one for the target.
For the target class, it was to create an object that was made out of a black circle and white rectangle. 
For the bullet class, it was an active object that moved left to right. 
For the launcher, when the mouse is pressed, a bullet was to be created.
